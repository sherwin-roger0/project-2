## Title of the Project
AN INTELLIGENT CROP RECOMMENDATION FOR SUSTAINABLE FARMING USING STACKED ENSEMBLE LEARNING.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Modern agriculture relies heavily on crop recommendations for farmers to make informed decisions about the suitable crops to plant. Machine learning techniques have shown great promise in revolutionizing agricultural decision- making processes. Several machine learning techniques, such as Multilayer Perveptron (MLP), Random Forests (RFA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were utilized for this purpose. 

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Implements advance neural network method.
- A framework based application for deployment purpose.
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- A specific scope of Chatbot response model, using json data format.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for coding the sign language detection system.
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of VSCode as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and version control integration.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, TensorFlow (versions 2.4.1), TensorFlow GPU, OpenCV, and Mediapipe for deep learning tasks.
